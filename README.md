# Shorthand

A bunch of shortcodes developed for my site, [goblindegook.net](http://goblindegook.net/).  [Shortcake](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake) is supported because, honestly, who doesn't love cake?

## Shortcodes

### Pull Quote

Renders a pull quote aside block with `pull-quote` and `pull-quote--<align>` classes.  Integrates with Shortcake.

**Usage:** `[pull-quote align="<left|center|right>"]<content>[/pull-quote]`

### Small Caps

Renders an inline element with a `small-caps` class.

**Usage:** `[small-caps]<content>[/small-caps]`

### Underline

Renders an inline element with an `underline` class.

**Usage:** `[u]<content>[/u]`

## Installation

This plugin is not (yet?) available in the repository, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install it:

```bash
$ composer require goblindegook/shorthand
```

If you want to know more about using Composer with WordPress, there's [a good introduction at the Roots project site](https://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/).
